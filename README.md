## ðŸš€ Deploying to Render

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com/) and create a new Web Service.
2. Connect your GitHub repo and select the `backend` folder as the root.
3. Set the following:
   - **Build Command:** `npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `node app.js` or `npm start`
   - **Environment Variables:**
     - `PORT` (Render sets this automatically)
     - `MONGODB_URI` (your MongoDB connection string)
     - `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` (your JWT settings)
     - `FRONTEND_URL` (set to your frontend Render URL, e.g. `https://your-frontend.onrender.com`)
     - Any other variables from `backend/config/config.js`

### Frontend (React/Vite)
1. Create a new **Static Site** on Render.
2. Connect your GitHub repo and select the `frontend` folder as the root.
3. Set the following:
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory:** `dist`
   - **Environment Variables:**
     - `VITE_API_URL` (set to your backend Render URL, e.g. `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/`)

### Notes
- Make sure CORS is set up correctly in the backend (see code).
- After both are deployed, update the environment variables if you change URLs.
- For local development, the defaults will still work with localhost.
